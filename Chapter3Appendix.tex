\section{Example Applications}

\subsection{Local Meeting Minutes:}
The following section displays a selection of meeting minute excerpts and their resulting output from OpenAI's GPT 3.5 model. For each example, I prompted the model with the prompt displayed within the body of the main paper and then fed the entirety of the meeting text from which the excerpt originated into the model.

Middle school math teacher Megan Grossbauer, received the district's 
Excellence in Education Award for leadership and contributions 
to the learning environment for students in the district. Those 
in attendance viewed a video of Mrs. Grossbauer filmed by high 
school teacher Don Goble.

Turning to the superintendent's remarks, Dr. Wipke congratulated 
Megan on her well-deserved recognition and talked about his recent 
podcast recording which included Megan. Dr.Wipke went on to share brief 
updates related to the transition back to in-person learning for
students and plans to remain aligned with St. Louis County Health 
Department recommendations as COVID-19 trends appear to be increasing. 
Dr. Wipke also highlighted the recent design meeting hosted by several 
architect team members from Ittner and Perkins & Will. Dr. Wipke 
commended Sue Blumm and her foodservice team for their quick planning 
to ensure all meals served at Old Bonhomme were uninterrupted as they 
were faced with a boil order last week.

President Jaeger called for Board committee reports. 
Dr. Buckner reported on the Finance and Facilities Board Advisory 
Committees.

President Jaeger called for superintendent committee reports. 
Dr. Buckner reported on the Superintendent's Finance 
and Facilities Committee.

One patron, Andy Cohen, addressed the Board during the time period 
set aside for public comments regarding agenda and non-agenda items.

Turning to the action agenda, Mrs. Jaeger called for a 
motion to approve the evening's consent agenda. On a motion 
by Mr. Johnson, seconded by Dr. Goldstein, the following
resolution passed on a vote of 7-0:

For this example, I prompted the model with the prompt displayed within the body of the main paper and then fed the first and last 10 pages of the brief from which the excerpt originates into the model.

\section{Alternative BERT-based Approach}
To highlight how Large Language Models (LLMs) compare to other modern machine learning solutions. I process all local meeting minutes within my sample using BERT-based Named Entity Recognition (NER). These models are trained to identify concepts such as people, locations, organizations, dates, and other entities from text and provide the next best solution to the problem of extracting public commenters from meeting minutes. For this application, I utilize an open-source implementation from the spaCy natural language processing toolkit. Importantly, I do not retrain the model to identify commenters specifically; instead, I rely on its ability to identify individuals' names with texts. To compensate for this lack of additional training, I preprocess each set of meeting minutes only to include the rough text surrounding their public comment sections, which I identify using typical section titles or specific references or calls for comments. I then utilize the model to identify all individuals within these sections and assume the proceeding text represents their address and comment. Given that the model can not distinguish between public officials and regular commenters, I remove all commenters whose names include formal governmental titles such as ``counselor,'' ``chair,'' or ``alderperson.'' \autoref{tab:NERComp} below presents the model's performance relative to that of the LLM from the main paper across both the training and unlabeled data sets. Overall, the NER model performed markedly worse than the LLM and required significantly more implementation and coding to transform the texts successfully. While a trained model could likely close this performance gap, the accessibility and adaptability of LLMs make them a far more attractive tool for transforming text-based sources.
