\thesisacknowledgments

Not to start too cheesy, but I would like to thank each member of my committee. Each of them has helped me at a different point along my journey, and without them, I would not have come close to finishing this work. Janet Box-Steffensmeier and Christopher Lucas, whom I admit I should have been in way better contact with, were incredibly supportive of my work and an absolute delight to work with. From struggling to teach undergraduates statistics or battling reviewers over the importance of mergers and acquisitions, working with these two had an immeasurable positive impact on me. I truly appreciate Andrew Reeves for providing positive feedback and critique since day one and for the fantastic opportunities to explore a subject I love. Without Andrew, I would have never discovered my passion for local politics. None of this dissertation would be possible without the encouragement and guidance from Betsy Sinclair, my chair. Betsy was and still is incredibly supportive of me and my interests, and I cannot thank her enough. 

Finally, I thank Dino Christenson for helping me become a true \textit{Dream-Liver}. Whether it was surviving the jungle of intro to American politics or foolishly jumping headfirst into well-established fields of research, every moment was some of the most fun I had during my entire six-year long journey. I am eternally grateful for these experiences and, most importantly, his friendship.

I would also like to thank my family and friends for their love and support. I could not do this without my parents' and brothers' help. Thank you so much for challenging me to go further. I would especially like to thank Ben, Ipek, Tony, and Jeremy for letting me waste hours of their productive time with my ramblings. I owe so much to my best friend Lily and partner Dani for everything they have done to support me. Thank you.

Last but certainly not least, I must thank my dog, Bucky. I adopted him at the start of my graduate school journey, and he has been awkwardly staring at me every step of the way. Without that chunky dog, I would not have survived the journey.
