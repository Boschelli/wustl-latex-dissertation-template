#WUSTL CSE Thesis template blank

##USE AT OWN RISK

So this template has been passed around quite a bit,
so I've updated it with the few formatting differences
that I made when submitting (the ones that successfully
passed the formatting screen).  I have no idea who originally
wrote it, I received my copy from Michael Hall and subsequently
modified it a bit to the form that is uploaded here.  

I take absolutely no responsibility (nor do any contributors
making updates) for the use of this template.  It is given
as is.  You may take it, modify it etc. for your own use. 


Add ons that are useful are found in tools, some various
scripts to embed fonts using ghostscript, etc.  


Here are the notes that you should follow when
doing various things, feel free to update if 
you find any other useful tips.

*Captions - use the square brackets to keep the table of
figures short, otherwise you'll end up with really really
long table of figures, ref: http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/11579/captions-for-figures-in-listoffigures
